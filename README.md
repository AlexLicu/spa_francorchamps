# spa_francorchamps
Spa Francorchamps circuit mod for GTA 5 converted for use on FiveM servers. Tested on FXserver Linux build 2683 and FXserver Windows build 2683.

This Belgian circuit of Spa Francorchamps is converted and edited for GTA V by GTABelgium, while using the GTA IV convert from Tanjes and onclsam13. Many thanks for their convert to GTA IV from F1 2010 game!

I only fixed "Poly edge" & "Physics validation failed" errors for all props, split textures so each .ytd is under 16mb to stream properly on FiveM and compiled everything in one resource.

The circuit is located in the top right corner of the map.

Installation:
  1) Copy the "spa" folder to the resources folder of your FXserver.
  2) Edit your server.cfg file and include "start spa" to your resources list.
  
Special thanks to:

- 3Doomer (tool GIMS EVO)
- Neodymium (tool Metatool)
- indirivacua (tool Cords2YMAP)
- Neos7 (tool Maphelper Maxscript)
